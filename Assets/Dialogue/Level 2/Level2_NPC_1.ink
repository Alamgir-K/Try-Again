Oh...You haven't heard of the news. #Colleague_Icon
What news? #Player_Icon_Confused
There is a change in management. You have been moved to another team, in another office. #Colleague_Icon
How come I've never heard of that change? #Player_Icon_Shocked
Because HR is being HR. #Colleague_Icon
Of course. #Player_Icon_Depressed
So, uh, where should I go now? #Player_Icon_Neutral
It's...um...that office with the blue door. #Colleague_Icon
Alright then, thanks. I better get going before I am late for clocking in. #Player_Icon_Neutral
By the way, your old keycard access has been revoked. #Colleague_Icon
Why? #Player_Icon_Confused
